            <h6>Problem</h6>
            <p>What was the problem?  Better yet, why was this prompt created in
              the first place?  As the role of the designer and developer,
              I had to figure out what other competitors had within their sites
              and what lacked based on user research.  The top problems that came
              up was the inability to upload files from both desktop and mobile,
              sharing files in the platform to others users and non-users, and
              larger storage plans that incorporated more affordable prices.

          <div class="solution">
              <h6>Solution</h6>
              <p>Entering into the market of cloud storage, I wanted to build an
                application that gave users the freedom and ease of managing their
                content without limits of gaining access dependent on their current
                location.  With this, I created a mobile application as well as a
                desktop site included features such as accessing files on and offline,
                having control over collaborating between files, and removing the constraints
                being put on consumers for adequate amount of storage needed and desired.

          <div class="process">
            <h6>Process</h6>
            <p>Why is user experience so important?  In simple terms, the users
              experience needs to be of utmost importance when designing a brand.
              An easily operated application means that the user will develop a
              relationship with the brand and thus keep coming back.  Lacking in
              understanding when it comes to who the target user creates a volatile
              relationship with both the brand as well as the consumers.  This is
              why when I sought out to gather information through surveys, user flows,
              and user research; I developed the personas based off the needs of the
              people rather than statistics. The results of the surveys taught myself
              that features like being able to organize files into folders and sharing
              a single item with another person, needed to be included as well as
              expanding the application to allowing access both offline and online.

            <h6>User Surveys</h6>
              <p>Taking and analyzing data of what users want to see in storage
                sites through user surveys.
                <p>
              <h6>The Results</h6>
              <p>Ability to organize files<br>
                -Sharing a single item<br>
                -Accessing offline and online<br>
                -Mobile and Desktop app<br>
                -Simple user interface<br>
                -Larger storage capacities<br>
                -Accessing storage usage<br>
                -Connecting with others<br>
                -Ability to upload files on both platforms (mobile and desktop)</ul>

              <p>Once the surveys were completed and the results had been gathered,
                the next step was to develop user personas.  The two personas
                were created based on the audience that is expected to be using
                this platform. <p>
