            <h6>Problem</h6>
            <p>What was the problem?  Better yet, why was this prompt created in
              the first place?  As the role of the designer and developer,
              I had to figure out what other competitors had within their sites
              and what lacked based on user research.  The top problems that came
              up was the inability to upload files from both desktop and mobile,
              sharing files in the platform to others users and non-users, and
              larger storage plans that incorporated more affordable prices.
          </div><p>
         <div class="float-box-solution box-solution">
              <h6>Solution</h6>
              <p>Entering into the market of cloud storage, I wanted to build an
                application that gave users the freedom and ease of managing their
                content without limits of gaining access dependent on their current
                location.  With this, I created a mobile application as well as a
                desktop site included features such as accessing files on and offline,
                having control over collaborating between files, and removing the constraints
                being put on consumers for adequate amount of storage needed and desired.
            </div><p>
          <div class="float-box-left wireframing">
            <h6>Process</h6>
            <p>Why is user experience so important?  In simple terms, the users
              experience needs to be of utmost importance when designing a brand.
              An easily operated application means that the user will develop a
              relationship with the brand and thus keep coming back.  Lacking in
              understanding when it comes to who the target user creates a volatile
              relationship with both the brand as well as the consumers.  This is
              why when I sought out to gather information through surveys, user flows,
              and user research; I developed the personas based off the needs of the
              people rather than statistics. The results of the surveys taught myself
              that features like being able to organize files into folders and sharing
              a single item with another person, needed to be included as well as
              expanding the application to allowing access both offline and online.

                were created based on the audience that is expected to be using
                this platform. <p>

              <h2>User Stories & Sitemap</h2>
              The user stories and sitemap was developed to distinguish features
              that will be included into it’s priority and importance.  Once that
              was sorted, I moved onto the user flows taking that information,
              focused on the priorities from the list to develop a site map for a
              better flow when it comes to laying everything out.<p>

              <h6>Wireframing</h6>
              The development of wireframes held an important part of the design
              process because it allowed myself to analyze the structure and the
              responsiveness of the design.  It also helped myself adjust interactions
              that could cause issues when the prototype was completed.  The wireframes
              displayed here are detailing the basic construction of the placement and
              layout of elements that are unique to the project.

                <h6>Branding & User Testing</h6>
                During this phase, I collected the designs and research I had
                previously performed through user testing and established a high-fidelity
                mockups that could be tested through the clickable prototypes.
                <p>
                In the beginning stages of the logo creation, I first sketched
                out possible options that we could develop into concrete designs.
                Once I narrowed down the idea and found a concept I liked, I then
                moved on to refining it into a monochromatic version that could be
                adjusted and display using the chosen color scheme.

                <h2>Preference Testing</h2>
                For the preference testing portion of the mockups,
                I analyzed three different designs with each have two variations.
                From the results, I was able to gather which display was more visually
                appealing to the users eyes.

              <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
              For the usability testing,  the tests that were excuted were meant
              to gather results from different tiers of experience levels that
              could perform specific tasks.  Having a broad range of expert levels
              provided me with valuable insight into changes and adjustments that
              needed to be made for better user usability.<p>
              The usability testing performed on our mockups were as follows:<br>
              IOS - Signing up for an account<br>
              IOS - Creating a folder<br>
              Desktop- Uploading a file<p>

                <h6>The Conclusion</h6>
                From start to finish, the endeavour to create an application that
                focused on cloud storage was both exciting as well as difficult.
                While designing and developing the project, I cultivated a better
                understanding of the importance of not rushing straight into the
                creation of a brand.  It takes a lot of time and effort as well as
                research and feedback to build a successful brand.  Without doing the
                important but necessary steps like creating user surveys and building
                site maps, it limits the designers ability to produce a product that
                will be accepted by users. </div>
