            <p class="text">What was the problem?  Better yet, why was this prompt created in
              the first place?  As the role of the designer and developer,
              I had to figure out what other competitors had within their sites
              and what lacked based on user research.  The top problems that came
              up was the inability to upload files from both desktop and mobile,
              sharing files in the platform to others users and non-users, and
              larger storage plans that incorporated more affordable prices.</p>

              <h5>Solution</h5></div>
                <div class="grid-1">
              <p class="text">Entering into the market of cloud storage, I wanted to build an
                application that gave users the freedom and ease of managing their
                content without limits of gaining access dependent on their current
                location.  With this, I created a mobile application as well as a
                desktop site included features such as accessing files on and offline,
                having control over collaborating between files, and removing the constraints
                being put on consumers for adequate amount of storage needed and desired.</p>

            <div class="grid-1">
            <p class="text">Why is user experience so important?  In simple terms, the users
              experience needs to be of utmost importance when designing a brand.
              An easily operated application means that the user will develop a
              relationship with the brand and thus keep coming back.  Lacking in
              understanding when it comes to who the target user creates a volatile
              relationship with both the brand as well as the consumers.  This is
              why when I sought out to gather information through surveys, user flows,
              and user research; I developed the personas based off the needs of the
              people rather than statistics. The results of the surveys taught myself
              that features like being able to organize files into folders and sharing
              a single item with another person, needed to be included as well as
              expanding the application to allowing access both offline and online.</p>

              <p class="text">
                Before moving onto developing a survey to gather information about what users want, I did a competitve analysis
                on three different storage websites; Dropbox, Pinterest, and Google Drive.  Looking at these websites, I was able to
               formulate the questions that needed to be asked in order to gather the information from users. </p>

                      In the beginning stages of the logo creation, I first sketched
                      out possible options that we could develop into concrete designs.
                      Once I narrowed down the idea and found a concept I liked, I then
                      moved on to refining it into a monochromatic version that could be

                    While designing and developing the project, I cultivated a better
                    understanding of the importance of not rushing straight into the
                    creation of a brand.  It takes a lot of time and effort as well as
                    research and feedback to build a successful brand.  Without doing the
                    important but necessary steps like creating user surveys and building
                    site maps, it limits the designers ability to produce a product that
                    will be accepted by users. </p>
