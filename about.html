          <h4>The Designer</h4>
            <p class="text">
              I was 13 when I got my first laptop.  It was the newly launched apple white macbook.  Before
              receiving this gift, I frequently used my mother’s imac and developed a fascination for apple
              computers.  Getting my very own laptop wasn’t just a new toy to me, it was the start of my dive
              into web design and coding.  My life outside my bedroom in which I spent hours writing html
              and css wasn’t easy.  Discovering that there was another world online, one that brought together
              similar interests through forums, was the thing I needed to help me find my passion.
              I taught myself the ins and outs of adobe photoshop, php code, and the process that one must
              take to build a website from the ground up.  My creative interests grew and web design
              fostered an outlet in which I was able to develop designs and projects that I was proud of.
            </p><p class="text">
              Design gave me a voice when I didn’t have one. It fuels my desire to create future projects
              and give voice to those who were like my 13-year-old self.
              Web development and design is constantly changing, but one thing that will never stop is my
              passion to form a world where words don’t need to be spoken but rather are seen through the visuals
              we create.
