          <h4>The Designer</h4>
            <p>
              I was 13 when I got my first laptop.  It was the newly launched apple white macbook.  Before
              receiving this gift, I frequently used my mother’s imac and developed a fascination for apple
              computers.  Getting my very own laptop wasn’t just a new toy to me, it was the start of my dive
              into web designs and coding.  My life outside the bedroom in which I spent hours writing html
              and css wasn’t easy.  Discovering that there was another world online, one that brought together
              similar interests through forums, was the thing I needed to help me find a passion.
              I taught myself the ins and outs of adobe photoshop, php code, and the process in which one must
              take to build a website from the ground up.  I grew within my creative interests and web design
              fostered an outlet to which I was able to develop designs and projects that I was proud of.
              <p>
              Design gave me a voice when I didn’t have one, and for that my desire to uphold the strength it
              endowed in me to allow future projects give voice to those who were like my 13 year old self.
              Web development and design is constantly changing, but one thing that will never leave is my
              passion to form a world where words don’t need to be spoken but rather seen through the visuals
              in which we create.
