            <p class="text">Asking for help or understanding what your struggles are can be difficult.  Having a place where others share common conflicts can provide a comfort that one might lack.  Many applications geared towards working on oneself and finding help are geared towards one specific area of support.  Such as online therapy, only providing therapy and nothing else.  Same as meditation applications, only providing meditations but not supplying other resources if that fails to work. Taking all this into mind, I wanted to create a place where it featured all different avenues for one to choose from to work on themselves.</p>

            <p class="text">The process of developing Solace was a multidimensional task of
                            looking at several different resources that are currently already on the market.
                            This consisted of meditation applications, online therapy platforms, and self-help
                            programs.  While doing this research, I was able to gather the pro’s and con’s of
                            each source and establishing a basis for the project of a new application.</p>

                Mental health has become a more talked about phenomenon within the past few years.
                Due to this, many applications have been launched that are geared to bettering
                oneself and  continuing the conversation that needs to be had around mental illness.
                In order to create a new resource for people to use and to better understand users,
                I performed a competitive analysis on three different websites, each one focusing
                on different aspects of help.  I studied 7 Cups, Headspace, and The Mighty.
                I dove into the audience that each one was reaching, their internal and external
                strengths as well as weaknesses, and opportunities that could provide a better
                source of recognition and user frequency.</p>

            <div class="grid-1">
            <p class="text">In order to formulate user personas, I executed a user
              survey to gather data from others on their usage of self-help applications,
              their experience with finding resources for themselves, as well as what their
              needs and wants are when it comes to their own mental health struggles.
                Through the user surveys, I was able to discover that:</p>

            <li>Users want the ability to find services near them</li>
            <li>Want a place to connect with others that share common issues</li>
            <li>The ability to read others points of view regarding their mental illness</li>
            <li>A place to learn more about mental health</li>

          <p class="text">Taking the user surveys data,
            I then proceeded to create user personas.
            Each one highlighting their motivations, needs, and wants.
            The three personas are unique to each individual,
            but represent the overall demand of users today.</p></div>

                    each resource, I was able to form the user stories and sitemap.
                    The stories were created first as they served as a stepping stone
                    for the development of the sitemap.  In the user stories,
                    I focused on creating a priority list of actions that users
                    needed to be able to execute for optimal user experience.
                    The actions were distributed from high to low depending on importance.

                    The tasks previously highlighted in the user stories were then
                    again used in the development of the sitemap and user flows.
                    The tasks that were showing of highest importance were as
                    follows:

                    <li>Creating an account</li>
                    <li>Adjusting settings dependent on personal needs</li>

                      <p class="text">Developing the identity for this project
                        consisted of first defining the name and slogan to be
                        attributed to it.  I researched several different possible
                        names and ideas that could represent the community that I
                        was creating.  I came upon the word Solace; definition:
                        comfort or consolation in a time of distress or sadness.
                        I played around with the name for a bit, testing it out
                        with different fonts and ways to present it and knew that
                        it was a perfect representation of this community.
                        From there, I started sketching different types of logos.
                        In order to be not too overwhelming but still providing a
                        unique quality in appearance, I was able to design a logo
                        that could be used in several different ways and represent
                        Solace throughout each.</p>

                        <p class="text">Once the name and logo was established, I moved onto
                        finding a color scheme that matched the identity of
                        a calming but trustworthy display.  The colors chosen
                        have been studied to be liked by both male and female
                        and elicit a sense of assurance.  To align with the colors,
                        the font style was then selected.  It was tested in
                        different weights, sizes, and formats in order to confirm
                        it held its proper identity and clearness throughout.</p>

                      <p class="text">One of the final processes of the development
                        of Solace came down to the prototyping and user testing.
                        The importance of these actions led to further improvements
                        within the functionality of the website as well as the ability
                        to test users on tasks that were laid out in user stories.
                          The tests asked in the user testing were as follows:</p>

                          <li>Signing up for an account</li>
                          <li>Accessing articles </li>
                          <li>Finding services near them</li>
                          <li>Filtering topics on the community board</li>
                          <li>Connecting with others </li>
                          <p class="text">The results of the user testing gave
                            me valuable feedback on design changes that needed
                            to be adjusted in order for better functionality.
                            Taking the results, the adjustments were made and
                            better performance was had.</p>

                    <p class="text">From the start, I knew I wanted to create
                      an application that was inviting, provided valuable resources,
                      connection to others, and contributed to breaking down the
                      stigma around mental health.  The process of researching applications
                      as well as hearing user feedback about what is lacking in this
                      industry was incredibly eye opening.  I learned a lot about the
                      importance of embracing inclusivity while providing knowledge to
                      anyone and everyone that uses this application.  This project gave
                      me a different outlook on the meaning behind mental health and the
                      ways we can continue to implement applications like this one in the
                      future to keep the conversation going.  We have the opportunity to
                      spread the word and normalize what it means to have a mental illness. </p>
